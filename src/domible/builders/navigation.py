""" domible/src/domible/builders/navigator.py

here we have a class to build a navigation element.
It's based on an article from web.dev:
https://web.dev/website-navigation/

I'm starting this on 2023-05-25, with a focus on bare minimum functionality.
There is likely a lot of static stuff, especially CSS and JS.
As of now, I haven't thought about how to dynamically include CSS and/or JS into these python elements.
Once/if I do, the hard coded stuff should go away.
