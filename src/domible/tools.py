"""domible/src/domible/tools.py

tools.py has functions for users of the domible package to do simple things
like open their HTML doc in the browser,
or save the HTML to a specified file.
tools.py imports other modules within domible thus should not be used by any of domible's submodules.
Any helper functions needed by domible should be put in utils.py
See the top level comments in utils.py to understand why tools.py exists.
